# Learn-Python
This is a repository to track my Python learning path.
I'm not sure how Gihub works yet either, I'm amalgamating my learning process for both Python and Github.<br>

I am currently utilising this technique to build this repository;<br>
 - Use the wiki to outline my plans in advance.<br>
 - Create an issue for each step.<br>
 - Use Projects and boards to keep track of my progress.<br>
